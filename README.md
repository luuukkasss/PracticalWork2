# PracticalWork2

===============
Description
===============
This web has been designed by Lucas Tejera Fragoso for Practical Work II. The objective was to make students capable of doing a HTML and CSS web. You will see a home page, with a navigation side menu with the other pages there, and several "posts" of the other webs, with a brief description of whats inside them. 
There is an "About Me" page, where you can find some information and photos, a "Topic" one, where you will find information about my Practical Work I topic, Large Lenguage Models, a "Net" page where u will be able to visit other parters webs, a "degree" web, with information of the Maths and Computer Degree, and inside it, a web with information of Fundamentals of Computer Engineering subject, and finally, a "contact" page, where you can fill a form, and "send" me a message.

Problems
===============
The main problem designing the web was the menus, both of them (the side one and the top one). Also, I have had difficulties with centering the elements and working with paddings,margins,  and borders.

Conclusions
===============
In this Practical Work, I have reached the conclusion, that every web has a lot of work behind, and that html and CSS has the same importance, because both of them are needed to a web to be useful and user-firendly.
