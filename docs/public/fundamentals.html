    As you know, this subject is part of the Maths and Computer Science degree.
    <br>You will start learning about the historical context about Computer Science. And after that, you will learn about different topics, such as software, hardware and networks.
    But this subject is not just learning and studying. In addition to this, you will have to learn to work as a team doing some activities, and you will have to do two practical works.
    <br><br>Now, this is a lis of all the units included in the subject:
  
     <br><ul> 
        <li><b>Module I - Computer Engineering in Society
        </b></li>
           <ul>
              <li>Unit 1 - Background and historical perspectives</li>
              <li>Unit 2 - The current context of Computer Science.pdf</li>
              <li>Unit 3 - Computer Engineering as a Degree and Profession</li>
           </ul>
        <li><b>Module II - Current paradigms and trends in systems and applications
        </b></li>
           <ul>
              <li>Unit 4 - Hardware</li>
              <li>Unit 5 - Software</li>
              <li>Unit 6 - Operating Systems</li>

        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Unit 9 - Information and Data</li>
            <li>Unit 10 - Data foundations</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Module IV</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Unit 1 - Introduction to software development</li>
            <li>Unit 2 - Software Development</li>

        </ul>
        <li><b>Module V - Introduction to web programing (HTML)
        </b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Unit 1 - Introduction to web programming</li>
            <li>Unit 2 - HTML</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Module VI - Introduction to web programing (CSS)
        </b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Unit 3 - CSS I</li>
            <li>Unit 4 - CSS II</li>
        </ul>

     </ul>
     And as told before, you will have to do two practical works:
     <br><ul>
        <li>Practical Work I: You will have to do an investigation project about a topic with our team.</li>
        <li>Practical Work II: You will have to do a webpage.</li>
     </ul>
